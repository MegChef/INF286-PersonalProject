                The moss stitch crochet stitch is made up of two of your basic crochet stitches. The single crochet stitch and the 
                chain stitch. Through using these two easy stitches, you can make the textured moss stitch. It goes by many names, 
                the granite stitch and woven stitch to name a few.

                    <dd>- Ch an even number of stitches (you can choose how many stitches you'd like to start with, but it should be even 
                        to keep the stitch pattern symmetrical).<br>
                        - Example: Ch 20 (or any even number).

                    <dt><b>Row 1:</b></dt>

                        - Finish with a sc in the last chain. (You will have a pattern of single crochets with chain-1 spaces between them).

                This stitch consists of the double crochet stitch, the single crochet stitch and the slip stitch. A crochet stitch guide 
                might be helpful when you come across this stitch. It’s most commonly used in patterns on how to crochet a blanket.

                        - Example: Ch 28 (or any multiple of 3 + 4).
                    </dd>

                The Elizabeth stitch is one of those really unique crochet stitches. It’s also been called the mini bean stitch 
                because of the raised rounded shapes the stitches make. It looks intimidating but it’s really easy to learn and is 
                absolutely beautiful.

                        - For example, if you want 20 stitches, chain 21.
                    </dd>
                    <dt><b>Row 1 (Foundation Row):</b></dt>
                    <dd>- Turn your work, and in the second chain from the hook, make a single crochet (SC) stitch.<br>
                        - Continue making single crochets across the row until you reach the last stitch. (Note: This is the foundation row, so just use basic single crochet stitches for this row).

            <div class="pa">

					<dt><b>Row 2 (First Elizabeth Stitch Row):</b></dt>
					<dd>- Turn your work.<br>
						- Chain 2 (this will count as your first half of the Elizabeth Stitch).<br>
						- Skip the first stitch (the first one is the turning chain), and then in the next stitch, make a half double crochet (HDC).<br>
						- Now, in the same stitch where you just did the half double crochet, make a single crochet (SC).<br>
						- Skip the next stitch (similar to the previous step) and repeat the process by making a half double crochet followed by a single crochet in the next stitch.<br>
						- Repeat this sequence until you reach the last stitch.<br>
						- For the final stitch, finish with a half double crochet (HDC).
					</dd>
					<dt><b>Row 3 (Repeat Row 2):</b></dt>
					<dd>- Turn your work, and repeat Row 2 for each additional row.<br>
						- Every time you work this stitch pattern, the Elizabeth Stitch creates a nice textured pattern that alternates between half double crochet and single crochet stitches, creating a raised look.

				The puff stitch is so much fun to work up. As far as unique crochet stitches go, this one is super easy too. 
				It creates soft puffs on your fabric. Like mini clouds. This texture looks great in scarves or blankets. I even think 
				it would make a sweater more modern.<br>
				<h4>How to Make a Puff Stitch:</h4>
				<ol>
					<li><b>Yarn Over:</b> Yarn over (YO) and insert your hook into the stitch or space where you want to create the puff stitch.</li>
					<li><b>Pull Up a Loop:</b> Yarn over again and pull up a loop. You should now have three loops on your hook.</li>
					<li><b>Repeat:</b> Repeat this process (yarn over, insert hook, pull up a loop) 3-4 times (depending on how puffy you want the stitch). You'll have 5-7 loops on your hook at the end of this step.</li>
					<li><b>Close the Puff:</b> Yarn over and pull through all the loops on your hook. This will close the puff stitch and form the puffy texture.</li>
					<li><b>Chain 1 (optional):</b> Some patterns may ask you to chain 1 to secure the puff stitch. This step helps to separate puff stitches for a more defined look.</li>

				If you’re looking for one of the most unique crochet stitches, try out the shell stitch. It’s so simple to learn to 
				crochet this stitch but it looks really impressive. It starts with single crochet. You can begin with fsc if you know how. 
				Then you go into the stitch pattern!
				<h4>How to Make a Shell Stitch:</h4>
				<ol>
					<li><b>Yarn Over:</b> Yarn over (YO) and insert your hook into the stitch or space where you want to create the shell.</li>
					<li><b>Work 5 Double Crochets:</b> Yarn over again, pull up a loop (you'll now have 3 loops on your hook). Yarn over and pull through the first two loops, then yarn over again and pull through the remaining two loops. Repeat this process 5 times into the same stitch or space to create a shell of 5 double crochets.</li>
					<li><b>Complete the Shell:</b> After completing the 5 double crochets in the same stitch or space, your shell is finished.</li>
					<li><b>Continue as Directed:</b> You can repeat the shell stitch in the following rows, depending on your pattern instructions. If working a pattern, shells may be spaced with chain stitches or worked into different parts of the row (such as skipping stitches between shells).</li>

				<dl>
					<dt><b>Start with a Foundation Chain:</b><dt>

					<dd>- Turn your work after making the foundation chain.<br>
						- In the second chain from your hook, work 1 double crochet (dc).<br>
						- In each following chain, work 1 double crochet across the row.<br>
						At the end of the row, you will have a row of double crochets.

				<dl>
					<dt><b>Row 2 (Creating the Primrose Stitch):</b></dt>

						- Work a puff stitch into the next stitch. (To make a puff stitch: Yarn over, insert your hook into the stitch, yarn over again, and pull up a loop.<br>Repeat this step 3 more times so you have 5 loops on the hook, then yarn over and pull through all 5 loops).<br>
						- Ch 2 to separate the puff stitch.<br>
						- Skip 2 stitches and work a puff stitch into the next stitch.<br>
						- Repeat the puff stitch and chain 2 separation across the row.<br>
						- End the row with a ch 3 turning chain, ready to turn for the next row.

					<dt><b>Row 3 (Repeat the Pattern):</b></dt>
					<dd>- Turn your work and repeat Row 2 by working puff stitches into the spaces between the puff stitches from the previous row.<br>
