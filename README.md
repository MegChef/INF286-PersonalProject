# INF286-PersonalProject

Welcome to my Crochet Corner! This website is a place where you can learn about different stitches and gather inspiration for a first
		or new project. I have listed 3 different types of stitches and have included links to different project ideas. On the about me 
		page you can learn a little about my crochet journey and see some of my projects and at the bottom there is a section to tell me
		about the users journey and I will add it to the about me page. If A user finds these projects and stitches to be helpful I encourage them to submit
		pictures of their completed projects to the about page.
