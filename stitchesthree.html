				This stitch pattern focuses on the single crochet stitch. Because it mainly uses this stitch it’s suitable for even beginner crochet. Pay attention to your placement of stitches and you’ll be able to create a thick fabric with the cluster stitch.
                <br>
                <h4>How to Make a Cluster Stitch:</h4>
					<ol>
						<li><b>Yarn Over:</b> Yarn over your crochet hook as if you were going to make a double crochet.</li>
						<li><b>Insert Hook into Stitch/Space:</b>  Insert the hook into the stitch or space where you want the cluster to be worked.</li>
						<li><b>Yarn Over & Pull Through:</b>  Yarn over again and pull through, leaving 3 loops on your hook.</li>
						<li><b>Yarn Over & Pull Through 2 Loops:</b>  Yarn over and pull through the first two loops on the hook, leaving 2 loops on the hook.</li>
						<li><b>Repeat:</b> Yarn over again and insert your hook into the same stitch or space. Repeat steps 3-4, making another double crochet (or whichever stitch your pattern calls for) until you have worked the required number of double crochets.</li>
						<li><b>Finish the Cluster:</b> Once you have the required number of double crochets (usually 3-5), yarn over and pull through all the loops left on your hook, closing the cluster.</li>
						<li><b>Optional:</b> Chain 1 (if specified): Some patterns may ask you to chain 1 at the end of the cluster for spacing.</li>

				This stitch uses only basic crochet stitches to achieve something that looks really complex. After a couple of rows, you’ll be crocheting full projects with this easy to learn the stitch. It’s also known as the grit stitch. You can find tutorials under both names.
                <br>
                <h4>How to Make a Lemon Peel Stitch:</h4>
				<dl>
					<dt><b>Foundation Chain:</b></dt>
						<dd>- Start with a chain of any even number of stitches.<br>
							- For example, chain 20 (or any even number) to begin the first row.</dd>
					<dt><b>Row 1:</b></dt>
						<dd>- Skip the first chain, and sc in the second chain from the hook.<br>
							- Dc in the next chain.<br>
							- Repeat the pattern: Alternate between sc in one stitch, then dc in the next stitch across the row.<br>
							- End the row with a sc in the last stitch.</dd>
					<dt><b>Row 2 (and all subsequent rows):</b></dt>
						<dd>- Ch 1 (this is the turning chain for the next row).<br>
							- Turn your work.<br>
							- Start with a sc in the first stitch.<br>
							- Alternate between dc in the next stitch, then sc in the next stitch across the row, following the same pattern as in Row 1.<br>
							- Finish the row with a sc in the last stitch.<br>
							- Repeat: Repeat Row 2 for the desired length of your project. Continue alternating between sc and dc across every row.</dd>

            <div class="parari" >
				This is a variation of several different crochet stitches. I’m sure you’ve heard of the puff and bobble stitch. While they are similar, the popcorn stitch requires the most yarn. All of these make great crochet stitches for blankets. Try popcorn out.
                <br>
                <h4>How to Make a Popcorn Stitch:</h4>
				<dl>
					<dt><b>Foundation Chain:</b></dt>
						<dd>- Start by chaining the required number of stitches according to your pattern. This is usually a multiple of a certain number depending on the stitch pattern.</dd>
					<dt><b>Work the Popcorn Stitch:</b></dt>
						<dd>- Yarn over and insert your hook into the designated stitch.<br>
							- Yarn over again and pull through (you should have 3 loops on your hook).<br>
							- Yarn over and pull through the first two loops on your hook, leaving 2 loops on the hook.<br>
							- Yarn over again and pull through the remaining 2 loops (this completes one double crochet).<br>
							- Repeat the above steps for a total of 5 double crochets (or however many your pattern calls for) into the same stitch. You’ll have 5 double crochets worked into the same stitch, and 5 loops on your hook.</dd>
					<dt><b>Complete the Popcorn Stitch:</b></dt>
						<dd>- To finish the popcorn, you’ll pull the hook out of the last double crochet, leaving the 5 loops on your hook.<br>
							- Insert your hook into the top of the first double crochet in the group of 5 (this is the "first dc").<br>
							- Yarn over and pull through all 5 loops on the hook.<br>
							- You’ve now created the popcorn stitch!</dd>
					<dt><b>Optional Chain for Spacing (If Pattern Calls For It):</b></dt>
						<dd>- Some patterns will have you chain 1 after finishing the popcorn stitch to give it more space and allow the texture to "pop" out more.</dd>

            <div class="parari" >
				This is one of those easy crochet stitches. It’s flat unlike some of the more textured stitches on this list. It’s as easy as the single crochet stitch. The key is working into the posts instead of the loops.                <br>
                <h4>How to Make a Waistcoat Stitch:</h4>
				<dl>
					<dt><b>Foundation Chain:</b></dt>
						<dd>- Start by chaining a multiple of 1 (or the number your pattern calls for), depending on the width of your project. You can use any even number of stitches, or follow the specific instructions given in your pattern.</dd>
					<dt><b>Row 1 (Base Row):</b></dt>
						<dd>- In this row, you will work single crochet (sc) into each stitch of the chain.<br>
							- Make sure to work through both loops of the chain in the first row, as this will help give you a clear guide for the next row when working the Waistcoat Stitch.</dd>
					<dt><b>Row 2 (Waistcoat Stitch):</b></dt>
						<dd>- To start the Waistcoat Stitch, chain 1 and turn your work.<br>
							- Insert your hook through the center of the "V" of the previous row's single crochet. Instead of inserting your hook under both loops, you will insert it through the two vertical strands that form the "V" shape of the previous stitch.<br>
							- It will look like you are working into the center of the V, creating a more solid and "knit-like" appearance.<br>
							- Yarn over and pull through, leaving two loops on the hook.<br>
							- Yarn over again and pull through the two loops to complete the single crochet.<br>
							- Repeat this process for the entire row: insert your hook through the center of the V of each sc from the previous row, yarn over, and pull through the two loops to complete the stitch.</dd>
					<dt><b>Continue:</b></dt>
						<dd>- Repeat Row 2 for each subsequent row. You can continue working in the waistcoat stitch for as long as desired, depending on your pattern.<br>
							- For the next rows, simply chain 1 to turn and repeat the process of working into the V of the previous row's single crochet.</dd>

				This stitch would make a beautiful afghan blanket. The crochet stitch guide creates what looks like little v’s all throughout the work. You’ll need to know how to use the double crochet stitch to achieve this pattern.
                <h4>How to Make a V Double Crochet Stitch:</h4>
				<dl>
					<dt><b>Foundation Chain:</b></dt>
						<dd>- Start by chaining the required number of stitches based on your project. If you're using the V Double Crochet Stitch, the foundation chain should be a multiple of 3 plus 2. For example, chain 17 for a base row that works well with the V-Stitch.</dd>
					<dt><b>Row 1 (Base Row):</b></dt>
						<dd>- In the second chain from the hook, work a double crochet (dc).<br>
							- Continue to work a dc in each chain across the row until you reach the last stitch.</dd>
					<dt><b>Row 2 (V Double Crochet Stitch):</b></dt>
						<dd>- Ch 3 (this counts as the first double crochet of the V-Stitch).<br>
							- Skip 2 stitches from the previous row.<br>
							- In the next stitch, work dc, ch 1, dc. This creates the "V" shape.<br>
							- You worked a double crochet into the stitch, then a chain 1 to create the gap, and then another double crochet into the same stitch.<br>
							- Skip 2 stitches again and repeat dc, ch 1, dc into the next stitch.<br>
							- Continue this pattern across the row, skipping 2 stitches each time and working the V-Stitch (dc, ch 1, dc) into the next stitch.<br>
							- When you reach the end of the row, you will typically end with a double crochet in the last stitch (if there’s an odd number of stitches left).</dd>
					<dt><b>Row 3 and Beyond:</b></dt>
						<dd>- Ch 3 to start each new row (counts as the first double crochet of the V-Stitch).<br>
							- Turn your work.<br>
							- In each chain-1 space from the previous row, work dc, ch 1, dc.<br>
							- When you reach the end of the row, complete the final double crochet into the top of the turning chain from the previous row.</dd>

				This isn’t as simple as the moss stitch crochet pattern but it’s worth it once you see how gorgeous it is. It uses several stitches and clusters to create a unique design. Master how to crochet a blanket with this stunning stitch.
				<h4>How to Make a Side Saddle Stitch:</h4>
				<dl>
					<dt><b>Foundation Chain:</b></dt>
						<dd>- Chain a multiple of stitches according to your pattern. The Side Saddle Stitch generally works well with an even number of stitches.</dd>
					<dt><b>Row 1 (Base Row):</b></dt>
						<dd>- Ch 1, then work sc in each stitch across the row.</dd>
					<dt><b>Row 2 (Side Saddle Stitch Pattern):</b></dt>
						<dd>- Ch 2 (this will count as your first double crochet).<br>
							- Insert your hook into the side of the single crochet stitch from the previous row, not through the top loops.<br>
							- To do this, insert your hook from left to right under the side of the stitch (it will be a small, tight loop), and then complete the stitch as a double crochet.<br>
							- Ch 1(this chain will act as a space).<br>
							- Now, in the next single crochet stitch, work a double crochet into the side of the stitch again.<br>
							- Ch 1 again to create the space.<br>
							- Continue alternating between working a double crochet into the side of the single crochet from the row below and chaining 1 to create spaces.<br>
							- End the row with a double crochet into the side of the last stitch.</dd>
					<dt><b>Row 3 (Side Saddle Stitch Pattern):</b></dt>
						<dd>- Ch 2 (this will count as the first double crochet).<br>
							- Turn your work.<br>
							- Repeat the pattern: work a double crochet into the side of each single crochet from the previous row, with a chain 1 between each double crochet.<br>
							- Continue until you reach the end of the row, finishing with a double crochet into the side of the last stitch.</dd>

				This is a fun variation on the single crochet stitch. Create this raised stitch using single crochet and chains, and some creative twists to the classics. It has a similar look to Tunisian crochet but without all the special tools. If you haven’t heard of Tunisian crochet pattern, check out this article on it and learn about all the fun stitches. If you want the simplicity of crochet with the drape of knit, you’ll love it.
				<h4>How to Make a Picot Single Crochet Stitch:</h4>
				<dl>
					<dt><b>Foundation Chain:</b></dt>
						<dd>- Start by creating a foundation chain with the required number of stitches (based on your pattern).<br>
							- Work a single crochet in each chain across the row (or into each stitch, depending on the foundation).</dd>
					<dt><b>Picot Single Crochet (Row 2 or Repeat Row):</b></dt>
						<dd>- Ch 3 to create the picot.<br>
							- Sc in the next stitch (or where you want the picot to be placed).<br>
							- After completing the single crochet, slip stitch into the 2nd chain of the 3-chain picot to form the small loop at the top of the sc.<br>
							- Continue by repeating: Ch 3, then sc in the next stitch, followed by a sl st into the 2nd chain of the 3-chain picot.</dd>
					<dt><b>End the Row:</b></dt>
						<dd>- Continue across the row until you’ve worked all the picot single crochets.<br>
							- To end the row, finish with the last sc into the last stitch of the row.</dd>
