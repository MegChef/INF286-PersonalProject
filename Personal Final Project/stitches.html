         <h3>Chain</h3>

         <div class="para">
            The crochet chain stitch is the first basic technique that all beginners need to know. The chain stitch is the simplest stitch on this list. Good thing, too, as it’s used as the starting point for almost all crochet patterns.
            Most patterns start with a number of chain stitches. A starting chain, or foundation chain, is a series of chain stitches that forms the foundation for the rest of the crochet project.<br>
            <b>To make a starting chain:</b>
            <ol>
               <li>Make a slip knot, and insert your hook.</li>
               <li>Yarn over and pull up a new loop.</li>
               <li>The first chain stitch is complete.</li>
               <li>Repeat to make the next chain stitch and the rest of the foundation chain.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
               Making chain stitches might feel tricky at first, but it will become second nature with a bit of practice.
               You can also make chain stitches between other types of crochet stitches to make different patterns. 
               For example, moss stitch is a beginner-friendly crochet stitch made from an alternating pattern of chain stitches 
               and single crochet.

            <dl>
               <dt><b>Step 1: Loop the Yarn Around Your Fingers.</b></dt>
               <dd>Place the ball of yarn on the table. Lay the tail end of your yarn against your open left hand, with the tail 
                  end pointing toward you. Loop the working end (aka ball end) of the yarn loosely around the back of your first two 
                  fingers. Cross the working end of the yarn over on top of the tail end, and to the left. Use your thumb to pinch 
                  the yarn where it intersects, holding it in place. Turn your hand toward you until your palm faces down 
                  toward the table. When you look at the back of your hand, you should see two parallel strands of yarn. 
                  The working yarn (aka ball end) will be on the left, and the tail yarn end will be on the right.
               </dd>
               <dt><b>Step 2: Insert the hook and pull up a loop.</b></dt>
               <dd>Hold the crochet hook in your right hand. Working from right to left, slide the crochet hook under
                  the right-hand piece of yarn and over the left-hand piece. Grab the left-hand yarn and pull up a loop. 
                  As you pull up, rotate the hook up towards you.
               </dd> 
			</dl>
         </div>
         <div class="pa">
			<dl>
			   <dt><b>Step 3: Chain 1 (or the required number of chains.)</b></dt>
			   <dd>Continue holding the circle of yarn in your left hand. Wrap the working yarn from back to front over the hook. 
				  Draw the yarn through the loop on the hook. This completes one chain. (This does not count as a stitch.) 
				  Note: The number of chain stitches you make in this step depends on the type of stitch used in the first round of 
				  the pattern. If your pattern starts with a round of single crochet, you’ll only make this 1 chain. 
				  If your pattern starts with a round of half double crochet, make 1 more chain for a total of 2 chains. 
				  If the pattern starts with a round of double crochet stitches, make a total of 3 chains.
			   </dd>
			   <dt><b>Step 4: Make stitches into the ring.</b></dt>
			   <dd>Now it’s time to make your first round of stitches into the ring. Insert the hook into the center of the ring, 
			      and draw up a loop to begin your first single crochet. (You will be crocheting over both strands: the loop and the 
			      yarn tail.) Complete the single crochet: Yarn over and draw the yarn through both loops on the hook. 
			      Continue making stitches into the loop until you have made the required number for your pattern. 
			      The ring may still look too loose and open, but we will fix that in the next step.
			   </dd>
			   <dt><b>Step 5: Tighten the ring.</b></dt>
			   <dd>Hold on to your stitches with the fingers of your right hand. With your left hand, pull the yarn tail to draw 
			      the center of the ring closed (like a drawstring bag). As you do this, the turning chain and the last stitch of the 
			      round will come closer together.
			   </dd>
			   <dt><b>Step 6: Slip Stitch to close the round.</b></dt>
			   <dd>If you are working in joined rounds, work a slip stitch into the first stitch to join the round. 
				 (Be careful not to stitch into your chain, but rather the first stitch of the round.) Then, continue with the pattern.
				  Finishing up: If the center ring loosens as you work the pattern, you can pull on the yarn tail again to tight it back 
				  up. Once you weave in the ends, it should stay tightly in place.</dd>

         <div class="para">
            The single crochet stitch is the next crochet stitch that beginners should learn. It’s a quick, easy stitch that’s super 
			versatile in crochet patterns. The single crochet stitch is abbreviated SC. In UK patterns, you will see it called double 
			crochet.<br>
            <b>How to do single crochet:</b>
            <ol>
               <li>If you are starting a new crochet swatch, make a slip knot and a beginning chain (foundation row).</li>
               <li>Insert hook into the next stitch, yarn over, and pull up a loop.</li>
               <li>Then, yarn over again and pull through both loops on the hook.</li>

         <div class="para">
            Slip stitch is a useful technique that can be used in so many different ways. You can use slip stitches to move the yarn 
			across a row of stitches without too much height. You can also use a slip stitch to join a round of crochet into a circle 
			by connecting the last stitch to the first stitch of that same round. Lastly, you can use the surface slip stitch technique 
			to decorate crochet fabric.<br>
            <b>How to do a slip stitch in crochet:</b>
            <ol>
               <li>Insert the hook into the next stitch, yarn over, and pull through the stitch and the active loop on the hook.</li>

         <h3>Half Double Crochet</h3>
         <iframe width="560" height="315" align="right" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ajIZThzJ36Q?si=CEnG30RI61MuxzkE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
         <div class="para">
            The half-double crochet stitch, abbreviated HDC, is another one of the six basic crochet stitches. In UK terms, it’s called 
			a half treble crochet stitch. The half-double crochet stitch is somewhat similar to the single crochet stitch. The 
			difference is that the half-double crochet starts with one extra yarn-over at the beginning. That extra yarn-over makes 
			half-double crochet taller than the single crochet, yet shorter than the double crochet stitch.
            <br>
            <b>Here is how to make an HDC stitch:</b>
            <ol>
               <li> Yarn over, and insert the hook into the next stitch.</li>
               <li> Yarn over and pull up a loop.</li>
               <li> Yarn over again, and pull the yarn through all three loops on the hook.</li>

         <h3>Double Crochet</h3>

         <div class="para">
            Next on our list of the basic crochet stitches is the double crochet stitch, abbreviated DC. Double crochet is one of the 
			taller stitches. A double crochet stitch is taller than a single crochet stitch and a half-double stitch but shorter than 
			a treble crochet stitch. Fabric made from double crochet stitches is a little more open and flexible than fabric made from 
			plain single crochet.

         <div class="para">
            The treble crochet stitch is the tallest of the six basic crochet stitches. You may sometimes see it called the triple 
			crochet stitch, or abbreviate as TR. In UK patterns, it’s called the double treble stitch. With an extra yarn over, a 
			treble stitch is even taller than a double crochet stitch. Once you learn the basic technique, you can add even more 
			yarn-overs to make double-treble and triple treble stitches.

            <ol>
               <li> Yarn over twice. Insert hook into the next stitch, yarn over, and pull up a loop.</li>
               <li> Yarn over and pull through the first two loops on the hook.</li>
               <li> Yarn over again and pull through the next two loops on the hook.</li>
               <li> Yarn over again and pull through the last two loops on the hook.</li>
